# mobile-runner
A mobile endless runner style game in Unity to take some rust of mobile development

## Project Objective

Since my last experience working with mobile games in Unity was back on early 2020, I think it is a good time to try playing around with it again and catch up with the latest changes (New Input System for example).

The project will be made in 3D, so I can also test out how optimization works for non desktop builds of 3D games.
